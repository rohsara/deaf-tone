# Deaf Tone Reboot
[ NYU ITP - Machine Learning for Web week 4 homework. Based on Yining's Hand Tracking KNN Classifier tf.js code. ]

Deaf Tone was an ICM assignment project in 20Fall semester with Jason Gao. (Read more on here: https://wp.nyu.edu/sararo/2020/11/14/p2-4-project-deaf-tone/)
For that version of the project, we used Teachable Machine Image Classifier to train ASL signs to play musical scale. Because it was an image classifier, it worked best for the person who trained the model (me) and didn't work that well for other users. 
For Deaf Tone Reboot, I'm replacing the ml5 image classifier to handpose instead. Also this time around, the player can train the model themselves for better accuracy.
